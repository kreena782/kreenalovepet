    <h2>❤️ Heartwarming Adoption Story</h2>
    <p>“10 years ago, I adopted Zeus from the streets of Bombay. One day, I felt a nudge on my toe and looked down to see this wide-eyed pup with his tongue out, wagging his tail as if to say, ‘Come play with me!’ I inquired around and got to know that his parents and siblings had all died and he was just a week old. It was a no brainer; I brought him home and since that day, he’s been my best friend. He’s always been protective of me and thinks he’s in charge of my safety. He’d literally go to any extent to protect me. I remember once, he saved me from a coyote who was about to attack me. He just stood before me and growled, as if to say, ‘Don’t even think about it.’ And every time we go for a walk in the woods, he walks ahead of me and ensures that the path is completely clear. The love doesn’t end there. Zeus even protects me from sadness. After my parents passed away, I'd often sit in a dark room alone -- he’d nudge me with his nose to tell me he’s there and just sit beside me, without demanding to play. It was almost like he knew what I was going through. He’d gone through the same, after all. Just sitting beside him, hugging and playing with him made everything better.
I don’t know how he does it, but he can always tell when I’m happy or sad, and his mood changes according to mine. He treats me like his own -- and on most days, he takes care of me more than I do of him. He’s family; my little brother, and I’m just grateful everyday that I’m the family he chose.”</p>
